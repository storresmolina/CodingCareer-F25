# Math 495R: Coding Carrers
Repository for Math 495R Class (Fall 2025)

This course aims to prepare students with basic coding backgrounds and abilities for technical interviews, teach algorithmic problem-solving and real-world project development. Students will gain hands-on experience with the most common coding interview questions (generally using the LeetCode 75 study plan), build a personal project on GitHub and sharpen their technical communication skills. The course is practical, project-based and collaborative, designed to bridge the gap between academic study and technical industry expectations.

This repository will be used as part of class participation where we will collect problems we solved in class, with proper documented code that will allow for review and proof of what we learn throughout the semester. 
The versions of the LeetCode problems submitted will be put to a vote in class where we compare people's approaches, explanations, and solutions.

See you in class!
